# ActionScript Dynamic Data Handling and Null Pointer Errors

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error: improper handling of dynamically typed variables and the lack of sufficient null checks. The `bug.as` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code attempts to process data of unknown structure (it might be an Array or a single Object). It uses `is` for type checking and directly accesses properties without verification. This approach is vulnerable to runtime errors if the data is unexpectedly null, not an array, or missing expected properties.

## Solution

The improved code in `bugSolution.as` uses more robust type checking with `is` operator along with explicit null checks (`if (data != null)` and checking the length of the array before accessing its members) to prevent null pointer exceptions and other runtime failures.  It uses the correct type checking approach and handles cases where `data` may be null or not have the expected structure.
